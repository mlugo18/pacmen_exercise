# PacMen Exercise

## Description: 
This repository contains a game for loading various PacMan images on the web browser and have them bounce around the page at various speeds and positions. When button "Start Game" is pressed, the script is run and the PacMen will start moving along the webpage and bouncing off the page walls when it each PacMan hits the wall (page limits). Each time you press the "Start Game" button, the PacMen's speed will increase. Pressing the "Add PacMan" will run the code to determine the position of the new PacMan image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of PacMen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each PacMan. 

## How to Run:
Clone the full repository to reside in a single registry. Verify the references to the images to validate the image links have not been broken. To play the game, load the index.html file to a web browser and press the "Start Game" and "Add PacMan" buttons as previously described.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
An enhancement to this game is to modify the pacman.js code to loop through the array of the four different PacMan images to add variety to the game.
